# What I learned:

Authorization is a huge component that changes how I view and will work on problems. Everything, even as innocuous as port scanning, requires authorization and explicit consent in writing to avoid any legal issues when doing any sort of work on a system. ROEs were also very interesting to me, learning how someone should explicitly write out the process in which we should test things is a good habit as it keeps all people on the same page and can be treated as a checklist during the testing process to not miss or forget any part of the testing process. As AI becomes a bigger part of our jobs and our work flow, keeping a human-in-the-loop is crucial to ensure that AI doesn’t drift and scope creep. 


# How I apply it:

In the first 90 days of my job or internship, I would like to learn more about their policies in which they apply authorization to testing, how they keep a human-in-the-loop and their plans with AI in the future, and what is their professional approach to ROEs in which they are applied and do they have them for more than just penetration testing.

# Muddiest Point:

For my muddiest point, I’m still curious about the approach to creating policy in the company? Is this always a process that is done by the office of information technology and is it done in conjunction with legal? Is this something that is done by department heads or is it a project given to younger individuals to learn the process and then signed off by a supervisor? I imagine every company has a different approach and process to these problems and I would like to gain more knowledge and experience with these in the future as they seem to be a skill of their own. 

# Relevance:

- This matters as OIT is very hands-on with AUP and ROE for testing
- There wouldn’t be a point in your career where knowing the legality of actions is important, with the case of the 2 pen-testers getting arrested at a county office coming to mind.


# Portfolio note:
For week 8 I added my reflection along with my capstone project
