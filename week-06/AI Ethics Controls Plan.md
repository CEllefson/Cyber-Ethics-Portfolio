# Controls & Metrics
Utilizing AI will require plenty of controls in place to ensure that flags are both rapid and accurate. Establishing a TP of ≥ 90%  would ensure that the AI remains accurate and can be recalibrated as needed. AI should be reviewed quarterly for small-medium businesses, monthly for larger businesses and critical infrastructure, or when TP is ≤90%. 


Some Controls should be HIL, or Human-In-The-Loop to ensure systems are properly monitored and regulated, along with ensuring the AI is not creeping outside of its original scope. An appeals path should be implemented to allow for people to get in contact with a human representative in IT if they are being wrongfully flagged. Finally a system of constraints should be created to ensure that the minimum required data is collected to monitor network and system security.


# Justification
These controls are here to help reduce the risk AI in sensitive systems can have, as a compromised AI system can likely be as dangerous as it is helpful. As AI doesn’t have moral agency or ethics, only what is coded into them by a developer, this can lead to issues of prompt injections by users or other attacks that can change the way the AI operates, even if only in subtle ways. Making sure that there is always a person involved in supervising the AI and kill switches involved can help with this risk.

# Reflection

Using AI can vastly improve the nature of system and network security, allowing for constant and rapid surveillance. As stated in the report on AI in critical infrastructure, there was a 98% detection rate of intrusions with a massive 70% reduction in incident response time but this can lead to ethical issues when used in less critical systems. ISPs and many websites already collect user data to sell and retain but use of AI can potentially lead to more collection of all data, even information that you may not want a business to have since you accessed their website. The Trade-Off seems to be for more security against cyber threats, individuals give a lot more of their information to these sites or networks and finding a balance to this is something I would like to revisit.
