# Privacy by Design: Monitoring Policy (Week 2)

## Principles Summary (_Personal Definitions_)
**_Notice/Consent_** is the required acknowledgement from the user to allow companies or institutions to collect data. 

**_Purpose limitation_** is the scope at which data collection is conducted and the amount of data collected, not allowing for more than what was originally agreed upon. 

**_Data Minimization_** is collecting the smallest amount of data required to accomplish a specific task. 

**_Proportionality_** is whether data being collected is important to the purpose of data collection or not, data outside of scope should not be collected. 

## My Monitoring & Retention Clause
This School monitors wifi access along with lab equipment usage to protect operations and comply with policy. Monitoring is limited to authorized purposes and assigned scope to be inline with the NIST Privacy Framework 1.1. Network anomalies will be flagged and reviewed by personnel, after which data collected will be disposed of after the 30 day holding period unless required for other ongoing investigations or litigation. Users receive notice at sign-in and through the AUP; personal communications are not reviewed except as required by law or incident response.

This School collects the minimum data necessary, restricts access to trained staff, and retains monitoring data for 30 days unless required longer for investigations or legal holds. Data collection and disposal is conducted in compliance with NIST Privacy Framework 1.1, CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986). Individuals may raise concerns or appeal via OIT Manager. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action. Users reserve the right to refuse data collection, but will lose access to network, computer resources, and other network connected school owned devices.  

## Justification
For the Monitoring and Retention Clause, multiple principles of data privacy were used. Data minimization is one of these key principles used and mentioned throughout the clause. The importance of collecting as minimal data as required to complete a specific task is a necessity for privacy protection. The NIST 1.1 directive states that “An organization’s cybersecurity activities also can create risks to privacy and civil liberties when personal information is used, collected, processed, maintained, or disclosed. Some examples include: cybersecurity activities that result in the over-collection or over-retention of personal information” which implies that the more information we collect the more likely we are to create issues of privacy and even security.

## Reflection

I would most likely tighten the time that data is held, but I have seen some standards of a few years rather than 30 days. I think it depends on the type of data being collected and what the use case would be for it. The appeals process could be more well defined but usually a ticket to OIT is sufficient, and may be escalated as needed.
