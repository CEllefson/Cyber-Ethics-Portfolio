# License Choice
For this I’m choosing GPL for the reason that at the moment in my life, I am more of a consumer than a producer of goods. My opinion may change if I begin producing products that I want to sell in a proprietary manner but open-source software is the most consumer friendly form of licensure. This allows for the best potential product, and while GPL does not require free distribution, it does often lead to free distribution and many free versions of products. Linux is a great example of open source software under GPL, with many products bundled within that are also free.

# Justification

For my choice, I went to the OSI (Open-Source Initiative) website and chose the GPLv3. I chose this because it is a very popular choice that is well recognized in the open source community. I love the freedom it gives to the community to use, modify, and distribute this code. If your code will be for proprietary purposes then do not use this license but if you’re creating public projects and want to build a community of programmers helping to make this product much better and have a longer service life, then this may be the way to go. GNU is an awesome example of this principle, its been around since 1983 and as of 2025 it is still receiving updates.

# Reflection

I would make this license more filled out. I would attach the GPLv3 License as found on the OSI website so others may reference it. The stakeholders are all people who use the product since it is open source, so ensuring the product is properly coded with strong security in mind would be good for all stakeholders.
