# License Choice
For this Iâ€™m choosing GPL for the reason that at the moment in my life, I am more of a consumer than a producer of goods. My opinion may change if I begin producing products that I want to sell in a proprietary manner but open-source software is the most consumer friendly form of licensure. This allows for the best potential product, and while GPL does not require free distribution, it does often lead to free distribution and many free versions of products. Linux is a great example of open source software under GPL, with many products bundled within that are also free.
