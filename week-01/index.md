# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

## My Ethical Lens
The Duty or Deontological ethical framework seems to be one that will be leaned on heavily during this course, and after reading through the professional codes created by the ACM and IEEE, they seem to permeate these with phrases like “do no harm” and respecting boundaries. Reading through the ACM, IEEE, and the ISC2, the ACM code of ethics and professionalism had the most concise and important points that I think will tie best with the “Ethics in Technology” eBook. The Deontological ethical framework was popularized by Immanuel Kant, who believed that moral duties are both universal and rational, and must be followed. He asserts that morality is derived from both duty and reason, and is independent of consequences. Again, the ACM speaks to the duty that people in IT and engineering fields must uphold. The entire document heavily goes through what is necessary as people in impactful fields should follow, creating safe and secure environments for data, and being truthful at all times. ACM 1.1 seems to be a great example of a Deontological ethical framework, stating it is an obligation to contribute to society and human well-being. 


## Authorization Principle
Authorization for me is the granted use of data, websites, or services from a vendor or owner to the end user. Hocking college has a very concise internet and wifi use policy, and this form of authorization is explicit and required by all end users for use.  Without accepting the terms of service of the AUP users are prompted with, there will be no access to university online resources. The authorization is an explicit agreement that gives the user access to network resources at the school location, but allows the school to revoke this if use infringes upon the terms laid out. 


## Policy Snippet
By accepting use of the network in this school lab, you are agreeing to use the internet services for purely academic purposes. This agreement is limited to use of this school wifi within the facilities and to be used by students, faculty, and affiliated personnel. Furthermore, students and faculty are prohibited from using TV and movie streaming services unless expressly authorized by the IT Department Manager or other Authorizing figures (i.e. Dean of University). Streaming services such as YouTube may be used in an educational format. Misuse of the internet or tampering with school networks or devices will result in immediate loss of access, disciplinary actions, and referral to authorities if necessary. Misuse includes illegal activity based on federal, state, and county law, in addition to school guidelines and policy. For any issues witnessed or personally had, please submit an IT ticket for assistance. During use, network traffic will be monitored within federal, state and local laws for anomalies, security risks, and illegal activities; data collected is restricted to security compliance, and will be reviewed and discarded with care. Users will not evade network monitoring.

## Reflection
I would refine my AUP with more legal context, including pertinent codes and references to OIT policy. I would personally like my Acceptable Use Policy to be broken up into several smaller paragraphs, to allow for easier reading and understanding. As stated in the ACM, all people who use computers and agree to use the networks are stakeholders, so transparency in the AUP is important. I also believe that having a few more legal references added could protect the company/school from liability, thus protecting more permanent stakeholders such as faculty or investors.
