# ROE Outline

This ROE is a hypothetical exercise created for a school assigment, no networks were harmed in the making of this ROE. 

Rules of Engagement

- Purpose: To penetration test host Wi-Fi and endpoint to improve network security, directed by the Head of OIT. 
 
- Authorization: OIT Head authorizes the security team to test Wi-Fi systems along with end points from 09/21/2025T1200Z to 09/22/2025T1200Z under this ROE. Authorization may be paused or revoked at any time by the OIT manager. Critical/high findings will be reported immediately to the Security Team Leader and the OIT Manager. All testing will follow this document’s boundaries, communications, and data-handling terms. 

- In-scope: Network systems and connected company owned devices are valid targets during testing, this includes: Routers, switches, endpoint computers, servers, WAPs, IoT Devices. Port scanning, website testing, input-validation, exploit discovery/controlled exploit use, password-policy checks, role-based access attempts are all authorized for this test. 

- Out-of-scope: Attacks on personally owned devices such as smartphones or laptops not owned by the company are prohibited. Destructive methods of physical intrusion are also not authorized for this test. Scope creep will be avoided and testing will be relegated to testing networks and devices. 

- Timing & deconfliction: All help desk tickets related to systems under test will be routed to the Security Team Lead during the time of this test. Testing will take place during the 24 hour period between Sunday 8AM (09/21/2025T1200Z)local to Monday 8AM (09/22/2025T1200Z) local in order to avoid critical business hours

- Data Handling: Only minimum-necessary data will be collected under the purview of this test. Storage will be encrypted and role limited, which will be retained until data is no longer needed or 30 days (whichever comes first) unless otherwise directed by OIT Head. CUI and PII will be redacted from information and hash will be provided on export. Reports will be sanitized of all sensitive information. 

- Communications & escalation: Test Lead (imaginary cell number) is to be contacted in the event of a Critical or High priority vulnerability being discovered. The Test Lead should then follow up with the IT Ops bridge as needed and Head of OIT under critical situations. Critical findings by the test team must be up-channeled within 15 minutes, High discoveries within 60 minutes, and lower discoveries may be reported on at the end of the test with documentation. 

- Reporting and Handoff: All data will be transferred to the test lead upon completion of testing on 09/22/2025T1200Z, where data will be parsed and a draft will be completed within 5 business days. Report should include what devices were tested and how, the threat vectors that were used, timelines of activities, tests performed and the results, findings, access paths, and if the test remained in-scope or if deviations occurred. Reports will include a remediation plan along with a recommended retest window to be coordinated with the Head of OIT. 


# Consent/Authorization

Upon signature of this document, you as owner of the data/network/devices/applications authorize this penetration test to be conducted within the defined rules of engagement. Authorization may be paused or revoked at any time deemed necessary during the testing period. 

# Escalation Contacts

Security Team Lead (Cell) and Test Lead (Cell) will be available during the duration of the test for critical/high vulnerabilities. The Head of OIT will be available at (Office Number) from 09/21/2025T1200Z to 09/21/2025T2100Z. Testing will be conducted within the boundaries of the ROE but will pause upon critical infrastructure vulnerabilities being discovered. Upon remediation of issues, testing may resume.

# Reflection

A narrower scope would be an interesting trade-off to revisit for another test. The smaller number of devices being tested would incentivise more creative approaches to defences and attacks but may also limit the ability of the team to thoroughly test the defense capabilities of the greater network. The devices and network being tested would ideally have a much better tested defense but if attackers don’t attack the items that were tested on the narrower scope test then it would be a fruitless exercise if they succeed.
