# What I learned

The Ethics in Technology textbook defines autonomy as “ The right or condition of self-government, especially in making informed decisions about one’s own body and health”.
It defines consent as “permission for something to happen or agreement to do something, especially after being informed of the risks and benefits”. These two terms are important in an everchanging world as we move in the direction of biotechnology, where it is not unthinkable that a person may have neurolinks or like devices installed that may have effects on the way people behave or view the world around them. Beneficence and non-maleficence are not defined in the book, but are both part of the 4 main ethical principles related to health care and autonomy. Both of these line up with the “Do no harm” and act in patients best interests. Justice is another one of the 4 pillars of healthcare ethics, and is viewed as the fair, equitable, and appropriate treatment of persons. One societal trade-off we are experiencing with the advancement of technology is that we are becoming more dependent on all forms of technology, requiring us to give up autonomy and much of our privacy. This is becoming increasingly an issue as our habits and likeness are permanently on the internet for companies to buy and use, and more of our personal information is uploaded whenever we need to use a service, which increases the effect. It seems like an increasing cycle that makes us feel more dependent on these services the more we use them.


# How I'll Apply it

A wearable brain computer interface device can be a life changing device for those that are differently able, allowing those to speak who cannot, and interact with computer devices for communication, education, and recreation. This is a massive leap forward in technology but can have some potential issues with privacy and autonomy when a device, as it gets more advanced, can record all your brain functions and processes, and who knows what else as time goes on. I think a policy of minimal needed information to conduct actions could be important and should be visited, with an additional need to delete data or at least averagise said data for reports to medical personnel who are supervising these projects. These would run into domains of not only PII but also with HIPPA so policy should certainly be adapted for use of these devices. Privacy and Autonomy are important principles that individuals using these devices should be able to retain, with a point of equity making these devices affordable for all who need to use, which can become an issue with the US healthcare system. 

# Muddiest Point

The matter of consent on the internet for the future seems to be worse as time goes on. Consent seems to be implied whenever you visit a website, post on social media, and other activities on the internet for companies to use your information and likeness for sales to advertising companies, data analytics, and even AI training. The question I would have for a person in the future is how do we maintain our privacy and ensure that consent is not freely given to all companies just because you visited a website? Is this a problem that is solved in the future or is it just the cost of business for us to use these services. 

# Relevance
- The example that frequently comes to mind is that of Instagram's AI being trained with artists art that they post on the platform, allowing AI to steal their style, as unique as it is, and mass produce what is currently shoddy art but eventually very similar quality art, and most people are not notified of these policy changes and if they are they are typically buried in documents that are several hundred pages long.
- The other example I talked about before but web companies and ISPs being allowed to sell your information to advertisers, which seems like a predatory habit, especially since they are being paid to provide internet not to sell your likeness and habits to other companies.
